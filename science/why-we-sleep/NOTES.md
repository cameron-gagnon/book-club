### Chatper 11: Dream Creativity and Dream Control

- pg. 219: Kids learn grammar rules and tenses implicitly before they actually
know them formally. In their sleep is when these rules are extracted from what
they've learned

- pg. 220: Dmitri Mendeleev conceived the periodic table of elements during
sleep, even after attempting to determine the ordering while awake.

- pg. 221: Paul McCartney's Yesterday and Let It Be both came to him in his
sleep.

*Note*: Basically, REM sleep helps you discover patterns based on problems you're
facing/what you know. Many anecdotal stories confirm this. Thomas Edison,
although a self proclaimed short sleeper, took frequent naps. He would sit in a
chair, put a metal pan on the floor below his right hand, rest his arm on the
arm chair with metal ball bearings clench in his hand, and when he would start
to dream, his muscles would relax and they would fall on the pan, waking him up.
Then he would write down all the creative thoughts he was having.
