# Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan

### Chapter 1: You Are Here (Decent chapter, would re-read)
* pg. 7: February 4th, 1990 Pale Blue Dot was taken. Almost wasn't taken. A few
project personnel opposed it. It wasn't science they said. NASA Administrator,
Rear Admiral Richard Truly, stepped in and made sure the images were obtained.
Why the beam of sunlight? It's an accident of geometry and radiation. The Sun
emits its radiation equitably in all directions. Had the picture been taken a
little earlier or later, there would have been no sunbeam highlighting the
Earth. Earth is blue because water absorbs red light much more than blue. The
atmosphere scatters blue light much more than red light. White from the Earth
being half covered in clouds on any given day.

* pg. 9: >
    Neptune for instance is blue but chiefly for different reasons. From this
distant vantage point the Earth might not seem of any particular interest.
    But for us, it's different. Look again at that dot. That's here. That's
home.  That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever
heard of, every human being whoever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of
our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and
economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every
creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young
couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer,
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every quote superstar quote,
every quote supreme leader quote, every Satan center in the history of our
species live there - on a mote of dust suspended in the Sunbeam.
    The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers
of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, and glory and
triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think
of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel
on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent
they're misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
their hatred.
    Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some
privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.
Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. And our
security, and all this fastness, there is no hint that help will come from
elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
    The earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere
else, at least not in the near future, to which our species could migrate.
Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where
we make our stand.
    It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character building
experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human
conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me it underscores our
responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish
the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

### Chapter 2: Aberrations of Light (Good chapter, would recommend a re-read)
* pg 11: Stare at the Pale Blue Dot. Try to convince yourself that God created
the whole Universe for one of the 10 million or so species of life that inhabit
that speck of dust. Now take it step further: Imagine that everything was made
just for a single shad eof that species, or gender, or ethnic or religious
subdivision. If this doesn't strike you as unlikely, pick another dot. Imagine
it to be inhabited by a different form of intelligent life. They, too, cherish
the notion of a God who has created everything for their benefit. How seriously
do you take their claim?

* pg 23: Modern science has been a voyage into the unknown, with a lesson in
humility waiting at every stop. Many passengers would rather have stayed home.

### Chapter 3: The Great Demotions
* pg 26: The Moon and the planets showed unmistakeably that they had as much
claim to being worlds as the Earth does. After millennia of philosophical
debate, the issue was settled decisively in favor of "the plurality of worlds".
They might be profoundly different from our planet. None of them might be as
congenial for life. But the Earth was hardly the only one.
    This was the next in the series of great demotions, down lifting
experiences, demonstrations of our apparent insignificance, wounds that science
has, in it's search for Galileo's facts, delivered to human pride

* pg 27: "Since space is mainly empty and near stellar collisions most rare, it
was concluded that few other planetary system exist... Absence of evidence had
been considered evidence of absence"

* pg 28-29: On the topic of light coming from other objects thousands and
millions of light years away: "If you add up all the 'begats' in Genesis, for
example, you get an age for the Earth: 6,000 years old +/- a little... If,
despite [the millions of light years light travels to reach us from far
planets], we were to accept the literal truth of such religious books, how could
we reconcile the data? The only plausible conclusion, I think, is that God
recently made all the photons of light arriving on the Earth in such a coherent
format as to mislead generations of astronomers into the misapprehension that
there are such things as galaxies and quasars, and intentionally driving them to
the spurious conclusion that the Universe is vast and old.
    This is such a malevolent theology I still have difficulty believing that
anyone, no matter how devoted to the divine inspiration of any religious book,
could seriously entertain it."

* pg. 33: "For any human being in existence to think that there is nothing in
the whole world Superior to himself would be an insane piece of arrogance" -
Greek philosopher Chrysippus

### Chapter 4: A Universe not made for us
* pg. 50: "...modern science 'presents us as accidents. We are caused by the
cosmos, but we are not the cause of it. Modern man is not finally anything, he
has no role in creation.' Science is 'spritually corrosive, burning away ancient
authorities and traditions. It cannot really co-exist with anything'...'Science,
quietly and inexplicitly, is talking us into abandoning our selves, our true
selves.' It reveals 'the mute, alien spectacle of nature'...'Human beings cannot
live with such a revelation. The only morality left is that of the consoling
lie' Anything is better than grappling with the unbearable burden of being tiny.

* pg. 50: Bryan Appleyard yearning for the "universe of Catholic orthodoxy":
"we were the end, the purpose, the rational able around which the great
aetherian shells rotated"

### Chapters 6-8 provided a lot of info on the solar system's planets
* wasn't super interesting, lots of facts, not as much story telling of a feel

### Chapter 9: An american ship at the frontiers of the solar system
See images in images/chapter_9 for notes

### Chapter 10: Sacred Black
* pg. 156: French expression "Sacre-bleu!" which means "Good heavens!" or
literally "sacred blue!" since Sacre-Dieu "Sacred God" was too strong an oath,
the second commandment duly considered, to be uttered aloud.

* pg. 159-160: The wavelengths of blue light are closer to the size of the
molecules in the air which ends up scattering the blue light more. Sunsets are
more red because there is more atmosphere for the light to pass through
resulting in more blue light scattering and the red wavelengths passing through.
Rayleigh scattering. Absorption and scattering can color a sky.

* pg. 166: It is now almost possible to assign color combinations, based on the
colors of clouds and sky, to every planet in the Solar System - from the
sulfur-stained skies of Venus and the rusty skies of Mars to the aquamarine of
Uranus and the hypnotic and unearthly blue of Neptune. Sacre-jaune, sacre-rouge,
sacre-vert. Perhaps they will one day adorn the flags of distant human outposts
in the Solar System, in that time when the new frontiers are sweeping out from
the Sun to the stars, and the explorers are surrounded by the endless black of
space. Sacre-noir.

### Chapter 11: Evening and Morning Star
* Summary: Venus is quite hot due to the extreme greenhouse gas effects it
experience with its thicc atmosphere. 90x the pressure on the surface of Venus
than on Earth due to its atmosphere. Venus emits many radio waves due to its
heat/atmosphere. Hot, somewhat Earthlike otherwise. Soviet Venera 8 (and more
onwards) and Pioneer 12 are only two missions to have landed on Venus' surface.

### Chapter 12: The Ground Melts
* Summary: Volcanoes! Olympus Mons or Mt. Olympus on Mars is the largest
volcano we know of. It's over 25 km tall (mt. everest is 9 km tall).
* Volcanoes help us tell how old the surface is based on impact craters and how
many there are.
* There are other structures on Venus called "pancake domes" that don't appear
on Earth
* Different kinds of vulncanism based on water, ammonia, nitrogen, or methane

### Chapter 13: The Gift of Apollo
* Moon influences much terminology: lunatic (those who sleep in moonlight go
crazy), menstruation (latin mensis = month from the word "to measure"), Monday
is named after the Moon, Month as well, "you might as well ask for the moon".
However up until recently, we never thought of it as a place
* Apollo program was more about politics and war than actual science. Proving
the US could launch essentially a missile to the Moon showed political and
wartime dominance. For these reasons, it was much easier to get money, people,
and backing for these missions.
* pg. 212 "For me, the most ironic token of that moment in history is the plaque
signed by President Richard M. Nixon that Apollo 11 took to the Moon. It reads:
"We came in peace for all mankind." As the US was dropping 7.5 megatons of
conventional explosives on small nations in Southeast Asia, we congratulated
ourselves on our humanity: We would harm no one on a lifeless rock."
* pg. 212-212: Six more missions after Apollo 11, all but one successfully
landed on the surface. Apollo 17 carried the first scientist, who was also the
last human to land on the Moon.
* pg. 215: Discussing the astronauts photographing the Earth on the way to/from
the Moon: "Those images helped awaken our slumbering planetary consciousness.
They provide incontestable evidence that we all share the same vulnerable
planet. They remind us of what is important and what is not. They were the
harbingers of Voyager's pale blue dot.
* pg. 215: "What began in deadly competition has helped us to see that global
cooperation is the essential precondition for our survival. Travel is
broadening. It's time to hit the road again."

### Chapter 14: Exploring Other Worlds and Protecting This One
* pg 221: Ozone layer depletion, greenhouse warming, and nuclear winter are all
tied to the exploration of other planets
* pg 221: CFCs were discovered by two university scientists working on something
else. Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina from University of California, Irvine
* pg 222: The CFC research was tied to understanding Venus' atmosphere since
Venus' atmosphere contains chlorine and fluorine.
* pg 223: Mars should have organic rich matter on its surface from nearby impact
of the asteroid belt but it doesn't. Mars also doesn't have an ozone and its
surface dust is quickly oxidized and destroyed by UV light. This is where Earth
is headed by punching its own hole in its atmosphere.
* pg 223: Global warming predictions are created and then tested against Venus'
and Mars' atmospheric makeups to determine if the predictions are right. Turns
out these predictions line up to the other planets, utilizing the principles of
physics and our acquired data from missions to these planets.
* pg 228: Of all fields of mathematics, technology, and science, the one with
the greatest international cooperation (as determined by how often the
co-authors of research papers hail from two or more countries) is the field
called "Earth and space sciences. Studying this world and others, by its very
nature, tends to be non-local, non-nationalist, non-chauvinist. Very rarely do
people go into these fields because they are internationalists. Almost always,
they enter for other reasons, and then discover that splendid work, work that
complements their own, is being done by researchers in other nations; or that to
solve a problem, you need data or a perspective (access to the southern sky, for
example) that is unavailable in your country. And once you experience such
cooperation - humans from different parts of the planet working in a mutually
intelligible scientific language as partners on matters of common concern - it's
hard not to imagine it happening on other nonscientific matters. I myself
consider this aspect of Earth and space sciences as a healing and unifying force
in world politics; but, beneficial or not, it is inescapable.

### Chapter 15: The Gates of the Wonder World Open
* pg. 232: The crews of these ships will step foot on new worlds. The first baby
will be born somewhere up there. Early steps towards living off the land will be
made. We will be on our way. And the future will remember
* pg. 237: SNC (pronounced snick. Short for Shergotty-Nakhla-Chassigny)
meteorites in Antarctica have been frozen and preserved. Deep inside the
meteorite is gas locked away still from millions/billions of years ago. The gas,
when analyzed, has the same isotopic ratios as the air on Mars. We know this
from direct measurements by Viking landers.
long that we've been able to study them. 

### Chapter 16: Scaling Heaven
* pg. 268: There may be no way to send humans to Mars in the comparatively near
future - despite the fact that it is entirely within our technological
capability. Governments do not spend these vast sums just for science, or merely
to explore. They need another purpose, and it must make real political sense.
    It may be impossible to go just yet, but when it is possible, the mission, I
think, must be international from the start
* pg. 268: Finding the right compromise between political feasibility and
mission success may be tricky.
* pg. 269: NASA budget, including human and robotic missions is about 5% of the
defense budget
* pg. 274: Even though there may be many small reasons to go to Mars or the Moon
again, are any of those individually worth it? Well, what about if they're all
added up? If we can be clever about reducing costs and forming true
international partnerships, the justifications become more compelling.
* pg. 275: An agenda for humans on Mars:
- US astronauts on the Russian space station Mir for 1-2 years to simulate Mars
flight duration
- Configuration of iSS so its principal function is to study the long term
effects of space environment on humans
- "artificial gravity" module on ISS
- More studies of the Sun to warn about solar flares and CMEs
- New rocket technologies similar to Saturn V
- Joint projects with NASDA (japanese space agency) and Tokyo University, the
European Space Agency, and the Russian Space Agency, along with Canada and other
nations. These should be equal partnerships
- Advancement of robotics and AI to aid in robotic return missions to return
samples from Moon, asteroids, or Mars
- Technologies to manufacture fuel and oxidizer out of Martian materials
- Simulations of the trip to study potential social/psychological problems
- New technologies involving constant-thrust propulsion (to help reduce trip
time and reduce radiation and microgravity hazards)
- Study of near Earth asteroids. Better intermediate timescale objectives
- Greater emphasis on science - including the fundamental sciences behind space
exploration, and the thorough analysis of data already obtained

* pg. 278: There are less tangible arguments that are attractive and resonant.
Spaceflight speaks to something deep inside of us - many of us, if not all.
* pg. 281: A stone age culture who hasn't been contact by much of Western
Civilization didn't know about frozen food, soft drinks, and wristwatches. But
they knew about Apollo 11. They knew the names of Armstrong, Aldrin, and
Collins. They wanted to know who was visiting the Moon these days.
* pg. 281: Exploratory spaceflight puts scientific idea in the public eye. It
elevates the public level of intellectual inquiry. The idea that we've now
understood something never grasped by anyone who ever lived before... It
increases the general sense of optimism in the society. It gives currency to
critical thinking of the sort urgently needed if we are to solve hitherto
intractable social issues.
* pg. 282: Discussing flying and weightlessness in space: "You become a living
satellite of the Earth, or a human planet of the Sun"
* pg. 284: Philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1959: "...a world without war need
not be a world without adventurous and hazardous glory"
* pg. 285: "Every time humanity stretches itself and turns a new corner, it
receives a jolt of productive vitality that can carry it for centuries.
    There's a new world next door. And we know how to get there."

### Chapter 17: Routine Interplanetary Violence
* pg. 301: Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter on July 16th, and 22nd of
1994. It's a once in a thousand year event. The dark spots left on Jupiter were
about the size of the Earth
* pg. 307: We have the technology and abilities to get to a near-Earth asteroid.
Either with or without humans. This is a way to get our feet wet again when
we're ready to re-enter the cosmic ocean.

### Chapter 18: The Marsh of Camarina
* pg. 311: The marsh of Camarina was drained to prevent disease, but its
drainage made it easy for other Syracusan forces to cross the dry land and
attack. It's a proverbial for eliminating a danger in such a way to usher in
another, much worse.
* pg. 313: Civilization threatening impacts require bodies several hundred
meters across, or more. They arrive once very 200,000 years about. Our
civilization is only 10,000 years old. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 reminds us that
these impacts still occur, and that the impact of a body a few kilometers across
can spread debris over an area as big as the Earth.
* Disaster is easily able to happen by manipulating asteroid's orbits. Could
nudge them safely away, or directly toward Earth. Blowing up asteroids could
result in smaller, less catastrophic asteroids, or many large and still deadly
ones.
* pg. 320-321: Pushing an asteroid into low earth orbit seems like there could
be no wrong-doing, backed by the argument of "only a madman" would do such a
thing. However, when certain decisions are made, often inside governments, only
involving dozens of people, it is much easier to see that people could be
pushed, persuaded, and forced into making certain planet destroying decisions.
* pg. 322: It's no use saying that all technologies can be used for good or for
ill. That is certainly true, but when the "ill" achieves a sufficiently
apocalyptic scale, we may have to set limits on which technologies may be
developed.
* pg 323: We must face the deflection dilemma. If we develop and deploy this
technology, it may do us in. If we don't some asteroid or comet may do us in.
The resolution of the dilemma hinges, I think, on the fact that the likely
timescales of the two dangers are very different - short for the former, long
for the latter.
* pg 324: Need a planned development of the technology. Track all the larger
asteroids, plot and learn about them. Then send robotic spacecraft to fly by,
orbit, and land on them. Then send humans. We don't attempt to alter any
trajectories at this time until the potential misuse of world-altering
technologies is much less.
* pg 324: If we're too quick in developing the technology to move worlds around,
we may destroy ourselves; if we're too slow, we will surely destroy ourselves.
* pg 325: When facing a common danger, we humans have sometimes reached heights
widely thought impossible; we have set aside our differences - at least until
the danger passed.
* pg 327: On other galactic beings: They will also have had to move worlds to
stay alive. "Their eventual choice, as ours, is spaceflight or extinction."

### Chapter 19: Remaking the Planets
* Utilize anti-matter engine with 100% efficiency in the future to move
asteroids around
* First humans on Mars will likely be very specialized and bring many materials
to the planet. However, over time, as the population grows on Mars, less
specialization will be needed and the trip will be available to more and
more people from Earth.
* We're able to alter our own Earth's environment and we're not even trying to.
It's possible to purposefully impact and terraform another planet.
* Create microorganisms that take certain molecules and combine or break them up
with other molecules. However, as we've seen with Mars, and Venus, atmospheres
are very sensitive to change.
* pg 343: "Thus all proposals for terraforming Venus are still brute-force,
inelegant, and absurdly expensive."
* pg. 344: On mars there isn't enough greenhouse effect. Could use ammonia and
create special microorganisms that convert N2 to NH3.
* pg 346: If there were a compelling reason to terraform another planet, it
might be possible on the timescale we've been describing.
* pg 347: In the process of terraforming, we'd likely destroy scientific
information embedded on and within the planets/asteroids/moons
* pg 348: "The notion of our descendents living and working on other worlds, and
even moving some of them around for their convenience, seems the most
extravagant science fiction. Be realistic, a voice inside my head counsels. But
this _is_ realistic."
* pg 349: "[Our descendants] Having seen at first hand a processino of barren
and desolate worlds, it will be natural for our spacefaring descendants to
cherish life. Having learned from the tenure of our species on Earth, they may
wish to apply those lessons to other worlds - to spare generations to come the
avoidable suffering that their ancestors were obliged to endure, and to draw
upon our experience and our mistakes as we begin our open-ended evolution into
space."

### Chapter 20: Darkness
For me, no signals, no one calling out to us is a depressing prospect. "Complete
silence, said Jean-Jacques Rousseau in a different context, "induces
melancholy: it is an image of death." But I'm with Henry David Thoreau: "Why
should I feel lonely? Is not our planet in the Milky Way?"

The realization that such beings exist and that, as the evolutionary process
requires, they must be very different from us, would have a striking
implication: Whatever differences divide us down here on Earth are trivial
compared to the differences between any of us and any of them. Maybe it's a long
shot, but the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence might play a role in
unifying our squab bling and divided planet. It would be the last of the Great
Demo sons, a rite of passage for our species and a transforming event in the
ancient quest to discover our place in the Universe.

In our fascination with SETI, we might be tempted, even without good evidence,
to succumb to belief; but this would be self-indulgent and foolish. We must
surrender our skepticism only in the face of rock-solid evidence. Science
demands a tolerance for ambiguity. Where we are ignorant, we withhold belief.
Whatever annoyance the uncertainty engenders serves a higher purpose: It drives
us to accumulate better data. This attitude is the difference between science
and so much else. Science offers little in the way of cheap thrills. The
standards of evidence are strict. But when followed they allow us to see far,
illuminating even a great darkness.

### Chapter 21: To The Sky!
* pg 368: Konstantin Tsiolkovsky from an obscure Russian town and Robbert
Goddard dreamt of using rockets to journey to the planets and stars.
* pg 368: The New York Times published articles that insisted that rockets could
not work in a vacuum.
* pg 368: Wernher von Braun, a Nazi, made the first rocket capable of reaching
the edge of space. The V-2. But instead of for exploration, it was a "vengeance
weapon" for Hitler. Building on his technical genius, Tsiolkovsky and Goddard
created the first rockets to get us to the lunar surface.
* This is one reason that in the long astronomical perspective there is
something truly epochal about "now"-which we can define as the two centuries
centered on the year you're reading this book. And there's a second reason: This
is the first moment in the history of our planet when any species, by its volume
by its own voluntary actions, has become a danger to itself-as well as to vast
numbers of others. Let me recount the ways:

• We've been burning fossil fuels for hundreds of thousands of years. By the
1960s, there were so many of us burning wood coal, oil, and natural gas on so
large a scale, that scientist began to worry about the increasing greenhouse
effect the dangers of global warming began slowly slipping into public
consciousness

• CFCs were invented in the 1920s and 1930s: in 1974 the were discovered to
attack the protective ozone layer. Fifteen years later a worldwide ban on their
production was going into effect

• Nuclear weapons were invented in 1945. It took until 1983 before the global
consequences of thermonuclear war were understood. By 1992, large numbers of
warheads were being dismantled

• The first asteroid was discovered in 1801. More or less serious proposals to
move them around were floated beginning in the 1980s. Recognition of the
potential dangers of asteroid deflection technology followed shortly after.

• Biological warfare has been with us for centuries, but its deadly mating with
molecular biology has occurred only lately

• We humans have already precipitated extinctions of species on a scale
unprecedented since the end of the Cretaceous Period. But only in the last
decade has the magnitude of the extinctions become clear, and the possibility
raised that the interrelations of life on Earth we may be endangering our own
future.

Look at the dates on this list and consider the range of new technologies
currently under development. Is it not likely that other dangers of our own
making are yet to be discovered, some perhaps even more serious?

In the littered field of discredited self-congratulatory chauvinisms, there is
only one that seems to hold up, one sense in which we are special: Due to our
own actions or inactions, and the misuse of our technology, we live at an
extraordinary moment for the Earth at least the first time that a species has
become able to wipe itself out. But this is also, we may note, the first time
that a species has become able to journey to the planets and the stars.

The two times, brought about by the same technology, coincide a few centuries in
the history of a 4.5-billion-year-old planet. If you were somehow dropped down
on the Earth randomly at any moment in the past (or future), the chance of
arriving at this critical moment would be less than 1 in 10 million. Our
leverage on the future is high just now.

It might be a familiar progression, transpiring on many worlds-a planet, newly
formed, placidly revolves around its star; life slowly forms; a kaleidoscopic
procession of creatures evolves, intelligence emerges which, at least up to a
point, confers enormous survival values and then technology is invented. It
dawns on them that there are such things as laws of Nature, that these laws can
be revealed by experiment, and that knowledge of these laws can be made both to
save and to take lives, both on unprecedented scales. Science, they recognize,
grants immense powers. In a flash, they create world-altering contrivances. Some
planetary civilizations see their way through, place limits on what may and what
must not be done, and safely pass through the time of perils. Others, not so
lucky or so prudent, perish.

Since, in the long run, every planetary society will be endangered by impacts
from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring-not
because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason
imaginable: staying alive.

And once you're out there in space for centuries and millennia, moving little
worlds around and engineering planets, your species has been pried loose from
its cradle. If they exist, many other civilizations will eventually venture far
from home.

* pg. 373: first time that we can both annihilate ourselves as well as postpone
destruction of our planet by going elsewhere

* pg 374: Of course we must keep our planet habitable or leisurely timescale of
centuries or millennia, but urgently timescale of decades or even years. This
will involve changes in government, in industry, in ethics, in economics, and in
religion We've never done such a thing before, certainly not on a global scale.
It may be too difficult for us. Dangerous technologies may be too widespread
Corruption may be too pervasive. Too many leaders may be focused on the short
term rather than the long. There may be too many quarreling ethnic groups,
nation-states, and ideologies for the right kind of global change to be
instituted. We may be too foolish to perceive even what the real dangers are or
that much of what we hear about them is determined by those with a vested
interest in minimizing fundamental change.
    However, we humans also have a history of making long-last ing social change
that nearly everyone thought impossible. Since our earliest days, we've worked
not just for our own advantage but for our children and our grandchildren. My
grandparents and parents did so for me. We have often, despite our diversity,
despite endemic hatreds, pulled together to face a common enemy. We seem,
these days, much more willing to recognize the perils before us than we were
even a decade ago. The newly recognized danger threaten all of us equally. No
one can say how it will turn down here.

THE MOON WAS WHERE the tree of immortality grew in ancient Chinese myth. The
tree of longevity if not of immortality, it seems, indeed grows on other worlds.
If we were up there among the planets, if there were self sufficient human
communities on many worlds, our species would be insulated from catastrophe.
The depletion of the ultraviolet-absorbing shield on one world if anything, be a
warning to take special care of the shield on an another. A cataclysmic impact
on one world would likely leave all others untouched. The more of us beyond the
Earth, the greater the diversity of worlds we inhabit, the more varied
the planetary engineering, the greater the range of societal standards and
values-then the safer the human species will be.
    Another justification for human presence in space: to improve our chances of
surviving the catastrophes we can foresee, but also the ones we cannot.

    To take out this insurance policy is not very expensive, not on the scale on
which we do things on Earth. It would not even require doubling the space
budgets of the present spacefaring nations (which, in all cases, are only a
small fraction of the military Budgets and many voluntary expenditures that
might be considered marginal or even frivolous). We could soon be setting
humans on or near-Earth asteroids and establishing bases on Mars. We how to do
it, even with present technology, in less than a human lifetime. And the
technologies will quickly improve. We will get better at going into space.

A serious effort to send humans to other worlds is relatively so inexpensive on
a per annum basis that it cannot seriously compete with urgent social agendas
on Earth. If we take this path, streams of images from other worlds will be
pouring down on Earth at the speed of light: Virtual reality will make the
adventure accessible to millions of stay-on-Earth's. Vicarious participation
will be much more real than at any earlier age of exploration and discovery. And
the more cultures and people it inspires and excites, the more likely it will
happen.

But by what right, we might ask ourselves, do we inhabit, alter, and conquer
other worlds? If anyone else were living in the Solar System, this would be an
important question. If, though, there's no one else in this system but us, don't
we have a right to settle it?

Of course, our exploration and homesteading should be enlightened by a respect
for planetary environments and the scientific knowledge they hold. This is
simple prudence. Of course, exploration and settlement ought to be done
equitably and transnationally, by representatives of the entire human species.
Our past colonial history is not encouraging in these regards, but this time we
are not motivated by gold or spices or slaves or a zeal to convert the heathen
to the One True Faith, as were the European explorers of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. Indeed, this is one of the chief reasons we're experiencing
such intermittent progress, so many fits and starts in the manned space programs
of all nations.

Despite all the provincialisms I complained about early in this book, here I
find myself an unapologetic human chauvinist. If there were other life in this
solar system, it would be in imminent danger because the humans are coming. In
such a case, I might even be persuaded that safeguarding our species by settling
certain other worlds is offset, in part at least, by the danger we would pose to
everybody else. But as nearly as we can tell, so far at least, there is no other
life in this system, not one microbe. There's only Earth life. In that case, on
behalf of Earthlife. I urge that, with full knowledge of our limitations, we
vastly increase our knowledge of the Solar System and then begin to settle other
worlds. These are the missing practical arguments: safeguarding the Earth from
otherwise inevitable catastrophic impacts and hedging our bets on the many other
threats, known and unknown, to the environment that sustains us. Without these
arguments, a compelling case for sending humans to Mars and elsewhere might be
lacking. But with them and the buttressing arguments involving science,
education, perspective, and hope-I think a strong case can be made. If our
long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to
venture to other worlds.
    Sailors on a becalmed sea, we sense the stirring of a breeze.

### Chapter 22: Tiptoeing Through the Milky Way
* Many of the danger we face indeed arise from science and
technology-but, more fundamentally, because we have become powerful without
becoming commensurately wise.
* "Necessarily, cultural differences would be cherished and exaggerated."
* Earthlings in space could provide protection against asteroids or comets on
rogue trajectories. This gives the space Earthlings the upper hand in any
disputes with those on Earth
* Some think we're approaching asymptotic limits to art, literature, music,
science, and technology. However it seems much more likely that venturing out
into space constitutes the beginning, much more than the end, of history.
* Even expanding into our solar system won't eventually be safe. Nearby
supernova, x-rays from the Sun, and the Sun becoming a red giant.
* If we must leave, so must have others in the universe. Why haven't they been
here? Because space is so vast and the stars are so far apart.
* If our optimistic estimates be true, and 1/1,000,000 stars shelter a nearby
technological civilization, and if they're randomly distributed throughout the
Milky Way, then the nearest one may be 100 light years away.
* Even if a civilization is 200 light years away, it's still another 150 years
before they receive the message, and then to respond is another 200 years.
* When we receive a message, we'd likely already be throughout the solar system
and ready to move on. Such a future may naturally evolve, even without any grand
goal of interstellar travel
* Our descendants may overtake the Voyager spacecraft, choosing to retrieve
them, or let them continue their voyage into space.
* Edge of the Sun's Oort Cloud is about halfway to the nearest star. It may
become just as easy to inhabit an asteroid of our own solar system as it is the
one next to us
* 550 AU away (about 10 times the distance from the Sun to Jupiter) is where
gravitational focus begins. This is only a year away if we can travel at 1% the
speed of light. Radio signals are enhanced, amplifying whispers. Obtain the
clearest, most distant images this way. May be used as a technology to explore
regions even further than previously possible.
* Brown Dwarfs may also be encountered as well as primordial black holes. They
decay by emitting radiation into space.
* Take a day to get to Mars if we accelerate at 1g until midway, and then
decelerate at 1g for the last half. Only a week and a half to get to Pluto, a
year to the Oort Cloud, and a few years to the nearest stars.
* But unless we destroy ourselves first we will be inventing new technologies as
strange to us as Voyager might be to our hunter-gatherer ancestors.
* If we continue to accumulate only power and not wisdom, we will surely destroy
ourselves. It is, I think, only a matter of natural selection. If we become even
slightly more violent, shortsighted, ignorant, and selfish than we are now,
almost certainly we will have no future
* Beings are quarantined from one another and that quarantine is only lifted for
those with sufficient self-knowledge and judgement to have safely traveled from
star to star.
* Will we eventually, when we feel content with our time and successes, exit the
cosmic stage? Millions of years from now - probably much sooner- we will have
made ourselves into something else. Even if we do nothing intentionally, the
natural process of mutation and selection will have worked our extinction or
evolved us into some other species on just such a timescale (if we may judge by
other mammals). Over the typical lifetime of a mammalian species, even if we
were able to travel close to the speed of light and were dedicated to nothing
else, we could not, I think explore even a representative fraction of the Milky
Way Galaxy. There's just too much of it. And beyond are a hundred billion
galaxies more. Will our present motivations remain unchanged over geological,
much less cosmological, timescales - when we ourselves have been transfigured?
* In such remote epochs, we may discover outlets for our ambitions far grander
and more worthy than merely populating an unlimited number of worlds.
* We may create new forms of life, link minds, colonize stars, reconfigure
galaxies, or prevent, in a nearby volume of space, the expansion of the
Universe.
* For all our failings, despite our limitations and fallibilities, we humans are
capable of greatness.
* Fish with rudimentary lungs and fins slightly adapted for walking must have
died in great numbers before establishing a permanent foothold on the land. As
the forests slowly receded, our upright apelike forebears often scurried back
into the trees, fleeing the predators that stalked the savannahs. The transitions
were painful, took millions of years, and were imperceptible to those involved.
In our case the transition occupies only a few generations, and with only a
handful of lives lost. The pace is so swift that we are still barely able to
grasp what is happening.
* For a very long time only a fraction of us will be out there. It doesn't mean
the Earth will be empty, much like fish are still around after amphibians.
* If we are in a jail, this is the escape hatch. Something worthy, something
larger than ourselves, a crucial act on behalf of humanity. Even now, this new
_telos_ is within our grasp.
* William James called religion a "feeling of being at home in the Universe" Our
tendency has been, as I described in the early chapters of this book, to pretend
that the Universe is how we wish our home would be, rather than to revise our
notion of what's homey so it embraces the Universe.
* No matter other life that may be, the only humans in all the Universe come
from Earth
