# Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan

### Chapter 1: You Are Here (Decent chapter, would re-read)
* Pg. 7: February 4th, 1990 Pale Blue Dot was taken. Almost wasn't taken. A few
project personnel opposed it. It wasn't science they said. NASA Administrator,
Rear Admiral Richard Truly, stepped in and made sure the images were obtained.
Why the beam of sunlight? It's an accident of geometry and radiation. The Sun
emits its radiation equitably in all directions. Had the picture been taken a
little earlier or later, there would have been no sunbeam highlighting the
Earth. Earth is blue because water absorbs red light much more than blue. The
atmosphere scatters blue light much more than red light. White from the Earth
being half covered in clouds on any given day.

* Pg. 9: >
    Neptune for instance is blue but chiefly for different reasons. From this
distant vantage point the Earth might not seem of any particular interest.
    But for us, it's different. Look again at that dot. That's here. That's
home.  That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever
heard of, every human being whoever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of
our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and
economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every
creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young
couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer,
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every quote superstar quote,
every quote supreme leader quote, every Satan center in the history of our
species live there - on a mote of dust suspended in the Sunbeam.
    The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers
of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, and glory and
triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think
of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel
on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent
they're misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
their hatred.
    Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some
privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.
Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. And our
security, and all this fastness, there is no hint that help will come from
elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
    The earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere
else, at least not in the near future, to which our species could migrate.
Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where
we make our stand.
    It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character building
experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human
conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me it underscores our
responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish
the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

### Chapter 2: Aberrations of Light (Good chapter, would recommend a re-read)
* Pg 11: Stare at the Pale Blue Dot. Try to convince yourself that God created
the whole Universe for one of the 10 million or so species of life that inhabit
that speck of dust. Now take it step further: Imagine that everything was made
just for a single shad eof that species, or gender, or ethnic or religious
subdivision. If this doesn't strike you as unlikely, pick another dot. Imagine
it to be inhabited by a different form of intelligent life. They, too, cherish
the notion of a God who has created everything for their benefit. How seriously
do you take their claim?

* Pg 23: Modern science has been a voyage into the unknown, with a lesson in
humility waiting at every stop. Many passengers would rather have stayed home.

### Chapter 3: The Great Demotions
* Pg 26: The Moon and the planets showed unmistakeably that they had as much
claim to being worlds as the Earth does. After millennia of philosophical
debate, the issue was settled decisively in favor of "the plurality of worlds".
They might be profoundly different from our planet. None of them might be as
congenial for life. But the Earth was hardly the only one.
    This was the next in the series of great demotions, down lifting
experiences, demonstrations of our apparent insignificance, wounds that science
has, in it's search for Galileo's facts, delivered to human pride

* Pg 27: "Since space is mainly empty and near stellar collisions most rare, it
was concluded that few other planetary system exist... Absence of evidence had
been considered evidence of absence"

* Pg 28-29: On the topic of light coming from other objects thousands and
millions of light years away: "If you add up all the 'begats' in Genesis, for
example, you get an age for the Earth: 6,000 years old +/- a little... If,
despite [the millions of light years light travels to reach us from far
planets], we were to accept the literal truth of such religious books, how could
we reconcile the data? The only plausible conclusion, I think, is that God
recently made all the photons of light arriving on the Earth in such a coherent
format as to mislead generations of astronomers into the misapprehension that
there are such things as galaxies and quasars, and intentionally driving them to
the spurious conclusion that the Universe is vast and old.
    This is such a malevolent theology I still have difficulty believing that
anyone, no matter how devoted to the divine inspiration of any religious book,
could seriously entertain it."

* Pg. 33: "For any human being in existence to think that there is nothing in
the whole world Superior to himself would be an insane piece of arrogance" -
Greek philosopher Chrysippus

### Chapter 4: A Universe not made for us
* Pg. 50: "...modern science 'presents us as accidents. We are caused by the
cosmos, but we are not the cause of it. Modern man is not finally anything, he
has no role in creation.' Science is 'spritually corrosive, burning away ancient
authorities and traditions. It cannot really co-exist with anything'...'Science,
quietly and inexplicitly, is talking us into abandoning our selves, our true
selves.' It reveals 'the mute, alien spectacle of nature'...'Human beings cannot
live with such a revelation. The only morality left is that of the consoling
lie' Anything is better than grappling with the unbearable burden of being tiny.

* Pg. 50: Bryan Appleyard yearning for the "universe of Catholic orthodoxy":
"we were the end, the purpose, the rational able around which the great
aetherian shells rotated"

### Chapters 6-8 provided a lot of info on the solar system's planets
* wasn't super interesting, lots of facts, not as much story telling of a feel

### Chapter 9: An american ship at the frontiers of the solar system
See images in images/chapter_9 for notes

### Chapter 10: Sacred Black
* Pg. 156: French expression "Sacre-bleu!" which means "Good heavens!" or
literally "sacred blue!" since Sacre-Dieu "Sacred God" was too strong an oath,
the second commandment duly considered, to be uttered aloud.

* Pg. 159-160: The wavelengths of blue light are closer to the size of the
molecules in the air which ends up scattering the blue light more. Sunsets are
more red because there is more atmosphere for the light to pass through
resulting in more blue light scattering and the red wavelengths passing through.
Rayleigh scattering. Absorption and scattering can color a sky.

* Pg. 166: It is now almost possible to assign color combinations, based on the
colors of clouds and sky, to every planet in the Solar System - from the
sulfur-stained skies of Venus and the rusty skies of Mars to the aquamarine of
Uranus and the hypnotic and unearthly blue of Neptune. Sacre-jaune, sacre-rouge,
sacre-vert. Perhaps they will one day adorn the flags of distant human outposts
in the Solar System, in that time when the new frontiers are sweeping out from
the Sun to the stars, and the explorers are surrounded by the endless black of
space. Sacre-noir.

### Chapter 11: Evening and Morning Star
* Summary: Venus is quite hot due to the extreme greenhouse gas effects it
experience with its thicc atmosphere. 90x the pressure on the surface of Venus
than on Earth due to its atmosphere. Venus emits many radio waves due to its
heat/atmosphere. Hot, somewhat Earthlike otherwise. Soviet Venera 8 (and more
onwards) and Pioneer 12 are only two missions to have landed on Venus' surface.

### Chapter 12: The Ground Melts
* Summary: Volcanoes! Olympus Mons or Mt. Olympus on Mars is the largest
volcano we know of. It's over 25 km tall (mt. everest is 9 km tall).
* Volcanoes help us tell how old the surface is based on impact craters and how
many there are.
* There are other structures on Venus called "pancake domes" that don't appear
on Earth
* Different kinds of vulncanism based on water, ammonia, nitrogen, or methane

### Chapter 13: The Gift of Apollo
* Moon influences much terminology: lunatic (those who sleep in moonlight go
crazy), menstruation (latin mensis = month from the word "to measure"), Monday
is named after the Moon, Month as well, "you might as well ask for the moon".
However up until recently, we never thought of it as a place
* Apollo program was more about politics and war than actual science. Proving
the US could launch essentially a missile to the Moon showed political and
wartime dominance. For these reasons, it was much easier to get money, people,
and backing for these missions.
* Pg. 212 "For me, the most ironic token of that moment in history is the plaque
signed by President Richard M. Nixon that Apollo 11 took to the Moon. It reads:
"We came in peace for all mankind." As the US was dropping 7.5 megatons of
conventional explosives on small nations in Southeast Asia, we congratulated
ourselves on our humanity: We would harm no one on a lifeless rock."
* Pg. 212-212: Six more missions after Apollo 11, all but one successfully
landed on the surface. Apollo 17 carried the first scientist, who was also the
last human to land on the Moon.
* Pg. 215: Discussing the astronauts photographing the Earth on the way to/from
the Moon: "Those images helped awaken our slumbering planetary consciousness.
They provide incontestable evidence that we all share the same vulnerable
planet. They remind us of what is important and what is not. They were the
harbingers of Voyager's pale blue dot.
* Pg. 215: "What began in deadly competition has helped us to see that global
cooperation is the essential precondition for our survival. Travel is
broadening. It's time to hit the road again."
