## Cosmos by Carl Sagan

### Chapter III: The Harmony of Worlds
* pg. 55: **"As a student, Newton was fascinated by light and transfixed by the
Sun. He took to the dangerous practice of staring at the Sun's image in a
looking glass: > In a few hours I had brought my eyes to such a pass that I
could look upon no bright object with neither eye but I saw the Sun before me,
so that I durst neither write nor read but to recover the use of my eyes shut
my self up in my chamber made dark three days together * used all means to
divert my imagination from the Sun. For if I thought upon him I presently saw
his picture though I was in the dark."**

### Chapter V: Blues for a Red Planet
* pg. 103: **"Station 202 retrieved. 10 December, 1973. 2230 hours. Soil
temperature, -10 degrees. Air temperature -16 degrees."** - Last entry in
Vishniac's journal as he went to explore the Mount Balder area in Antarctica
trying to implant soil samples to later retrieve a month later


### Chapter VII: Backbone of the Night
* pg. 139: Milky Way is called the Milky Way because Hera had Heracles on her
teet and when she awoke she didn't like him (cuz he was born out of an affair)
and a bit of milk squirted out and the Greeks called this a greek phrase which
came to be translated as the "Milky Way"
* pg. 149: **"Those zealous idolators [counted] it a great blasphemy to make their
God a stone, whereas notwithstanding they were so senseless in their adoration
of idols as to make a stone their God."** -John Wilkins commenting in 1638 on
Athenians
* pg. 151: When sqrt(2) couldn't be expressed accurately as a ratio of any two
whole numbers, a crisis arose. **"'Irrational' originally meant only that a
number could not be expressed as a ratio. But for the Pythagoreans it came to
mean something threatening, a hint that their wold view might not make sense,
which is today the other meaning of 'irrational'"**

### Chapter IX:  The Lives of the Stars
* pg. 181: Edward Kasner (an American mathematician) once asked his 9 year old
his nephew to name an extremely large number. 10^100. 1 followed by 100 zeros.
He called it a googol. googolplex is 10^(10^100). These numbers are massive and
hard to imagine. All the elementary particles in the universe are only about
10^80. If it were packed solid it would still only be 10^128.

### Chapter X: The Edge of Forever
* pg. 219: A fourthdimensional hypercube is called a tesseract. Shoutout Marvel.

### Chapter XI: The Persistence of Memory
* pg. 226: Whales 'sing' around 20Hz (Hertz is one crest and trough every
second). There is more noise pollution from boats in the ocean, effectively
dampening the distance at which whales could communicate, which was about
10,000Km.
* pg. 229: DNA remembers how to break down sugar from an Apple, how to create
bones, how to grow. There are about 5 x 10^9 bits of information in our DNA. DNA
has had billions of years of evolution to perfect this. But what if our
environment was changing so fast that it couldn't evolve fast enough? That is
where our brain comes in.
* pg. 230: 10^14 neural connections in our brain
* pg. 232: A time came where we needed to store more information than our genes
or brain could hold. We created books. One glance at a book and you'll hear the
author, perhaps dead for thousands of years speaking clearly, silently, across
the millennia, inside your head.
* pg. 232: "Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic"
* pg. 238-239: On each Voyager spacecraft, we put a gold plated copper
phonograph. We didn't put information on science, because whoever intercepts
these spacecraft likely know much more about science than we do. We included
things of interest about ourselves. There are greetings in over 60 languages,
the hellos of humpback whales. Pictures of humans working, 1.5 hrs of exquisite
music from many cultures. It is, as much as the sounds of any baleen whale, a
love song cast upon the vastness of the deep. Many, perhaps most, of our
messages will be indecipherable. But we have sent them because it is important
to try.
* pg. 239: Recorded the brain, heart, eyes, muscles' electrical impulses,
transcribed them into sound and compressed them onto the record. We've sent the
representation of a woman for an hour in June of 1977 into the Cosmos.

### Chapter XII: Encyclopaedia Galactica
* pg. 245: Is there some kind of interstellar rosetta stone? We believe there
is a common language that all technical civilizations, no matter how different,
must have. That language is science and mathematics. The laws of nature are the
same everywhere, gravity pulls distant planets around suns and other bodies just
the same.
* pg. 257: No civilization can possibly survive to a space faring age unless it
limits its numbers. Any society with a marked population explosion will be
forced to devote all of its energies and technological skills to feeding and
caring for the population on its home planet.

!!! note: Our images and depictions of contact with aliens is likely far off from the
truth. Small differences in time scales and technological advances create large
rifts in actual abilities. For example, Colombus and Arawaks, Cortes and the
Aztecs, even the fate of the Tlingit in the generations after La Perouse.

### Chapter XIII: Who speaks for Earth?
* pg. 264: "Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little
difficult to maintain when we see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading
to become an inconspicuous point of light against the bastion and citadel of the
stars. Travel is broadening"
* pg. 265: Conventional bombs in WWII were called block busters. Filled with 20
tons of TNT, they were capable of destroying one city block. Nowadays, a single
nuclear bomb contains the same amount of energy (2 million tons, or 2 megatons
of TNT) as all of the bombs dropped during WWII (100,000 blockbusters).
* pg. 270: Richardson, _The Statistics of Deadly Quarrels_. Discusses wars with
a magnitude of M, where a war of magnitude M is represented as 10^M=number of
deaths. Accounting for population and the pattern of previous wars, a doomsday
war is expected in the thirtieth century. However, if our rate of
growth/technological change occurs faster than anticipated, doomsday could occur
earlier.
* pg. 272: We know who speaks for the nations, for the states. But who speaks
for the humans, for the Earth?
* pg. 273: Full scale nuclear war has never happened. Somehow this is taken to
imply that it never will. But we can experience it only once. Then it will be
too late to reformulate the statistics.
* pg. 273: We, the nuclear hostages - the people of the Earth...
* pg. 273: We must make every effort to understand that our fellow humans,
all over the world, _are_ human.
* pg. 275: "Superstition [is] cowardice in the face of the Divine".
- Theophrastus (lived during the founding of the Library of Alexandria)
* pg. 275: We inahbit a universe where atoms are made in the centers of stars;
where each second a thousand suns are born; where life is sparked by sunlight
and lightning in the airs and waters of youthful planets; where the raw material
for biological evolution is sometimes made by the explosion of a star halfway
across the Milky Way; where a thing as beautiful as a galaxy is formed a hundred
billion times... How pallid by comparison are the pretensions of superstition
and pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue and understand science,
that characteristically human endeavor.
* pg. 276: "There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far,
entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex
for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is
only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self-correcting, ongoing,
applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no sacred truths;
all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are
worthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or
revised. We must understand the Cosmos as it is and not confuse how it is with
how we wish it to be. The obvious is sometimes false; the unexpected is
sometimes true. Humans everywhere share the same goals when the context is large
enough. And the study of the Cosmos provides the largest possible context."
* pg. 283: "An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human
beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the
similarities. The Cosmos may be densely populated with intelligent beings. But
the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here.
Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every
one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with
you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another."
* pg. 285: The total cost of a mission such as Viking to Mars, or Voyager to the
outer solar system, is less than that of the 1979-1980 Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.
* pg. 286: For we are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to self-awareness.
We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars;
organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the
evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey by which, here at least,
consciousness arose. Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. _We_ speak
for the Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also
to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.
