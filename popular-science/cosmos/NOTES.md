## Cosmos by Carl Sagan

### Chapter III: The Harmony of Worlds
* pg. 55: **"As a student, Newton was fascinated by light and transfixed by the
Sun. He took to the dangerous practice of staring at the Sun's image in a
looking glass: > In a few hours I had brought my eyes to such a pass that I
could look upon no bright object with neither eye but I saw the Sun before me,
so that I durst neither write nor read but to recover the use of my eyes shut
my self up in my chamber made dark three days together * used all means to
divert my imagination from the Sun. For if I thought upon him I presently saw
his picture though I was in the dark."**

### Chapter V: Blues for a Red Planet
* pg. 103: **"Station 202 retrieved. 10 December, 1973. 2230 hours. Soil
temperature, -10 degrees. Air temperature -16 degrees."** - Last entry in
Vishniac's journal as he went to explore the Mount Balder area in Antarctica
trying to implant soil samples to later retrieve a month later


### Chapter VII: Backbone of the Night
* pg. 139: Milky Way is called the Milky Way because Hera had Heracles on her
teet and when she awoke she didn't like him (cuz he was born out of an affair)
and a bit of milk squirted out and the Greeks called this a greek phrase which
came to be translated as the "Milky Way"
* pg. 149: **"Those zealous idolators [counted] it a great blasphemy to make their
God a stone, whereas notwithstanding they were so senseless in their adoration
of idols as to make a stone their God."** -John Wilkins commenting in 1638 on
Athenians
* pg. 151: When sqrt(2) couldn't be expressed accurately as a ratio of any two
whole numbers, a crisis arose. **"'Irrational' originally meant only that a
number could not be expressed as a ratio. But for the Pythagoreans it came to
mean something threatening, a hint that their wold view might not make sense,
which is today the other meaning of 'irrational'"**
